# User input
# Python uses the input() function to get the users input. It can be used for almost every popular thing such as website, mobile, app or video game nowadays.

# username = input("What's your name?")

# int()
# another function that can be wrapped around the input() to convert the text string into a number

# age = int(input('Your age?'))

# Task
#Create a hypotenuse.py program that asks
#the user for two numbers, a and b, and then calculates the hypotenuse c
# Note: To make the square root, we will have to wrap the variables in parentese and add 0.5 as an exponent (**)

a = 5
b = 8

c = (a**2 + b**2)**0.5

print(c)
